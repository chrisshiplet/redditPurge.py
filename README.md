redditPurge.py
======

redditPurge is a simple script I wrote while learning Python. It destroys your entire Reddit history, letting you start with a clean slate or delete your account with less of a trace. 

**usage:** `./redditPurge.py username password`

**license:** Do whatever you want with it! If you find it useful please send a tweet ([@nearengine](http://twitter.com/nearengine)) or link to this page.
